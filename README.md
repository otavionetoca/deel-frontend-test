# Coding challenge

This is the result of a coding challenge proposed by Deel.

# Considerations

- It is recommended to use Node 16 LTS in order to run the project.
- By default it runs at port 3000 and it can be adjusted to your preference through the `package.json` file.

# Installation
In your terminal run:
```bash
npm install
```
or
```bash
yarn install
```

# Running the project
In your terminal run:
```bash
npm run dev
```
You can access it by going to http://localhost:3000.

# Is it production ready?
- No and there are comments as ```//TODO:``` in the code base as per requested.
- It would be good to put on a little bit of time to clean up the code so other devs do not have a bad time maintaining this component.
- Also, it would be great to decouple it a little bit more, at the moment it takes only an array of strings as the completion suggestions.
- Other than that, it looks good :).
